## About
The Chess Game Visualizer (CGV) is a free-to-use program hosted on https://printchessgames.com, designed to turn Portable Game Notation (PGN) into pictures of the game. CGV was written using HTML5, JavaScript (vanilla), and Node.js (zero dependencies) by Taylor Lovell Shockey in February, 2019 as a solution to a problem he noticed while working as a chess instructor.
> ### How does a chess instructor provide individualized feedback on games to a classroom of kids in a printed format that is clean, compact, and easy to understand?

## Example
To view an example game outlining the various features of CGV:
1. Go to https://printchessgames.com.
2. Click the "example" button in the top menu.
3. Wait for the PGN to be processed by the server and then scroll-down to see the results.
